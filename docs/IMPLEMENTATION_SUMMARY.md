# Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Specifications Updated ✅

Created comprehensive EARS-format specifications for key commands:

- **`specs/mine-command.md`** - Complete specification for `ji mine` command with project filtering, caching, and sorting behavior
- **`specs/log-command.md`** - Interactive comment viewer specification (already existed)
- **`specs/take-command.md`** - Issue assignment command specification  
- **`specs/issue-command.md`** - Issue view and sync subcommands specification
- **`specs/search-command.md`** - Full-text search across Jira and Confluence specification
- **`specs/sync-command.md`** - Workspace synchronization specification
- **`specs/auth-command.md`** - Authentication setup specification

### 2. MSW Installation and Setup ✅

- **Installed MSW 2.10.4** as dev dependency
- **Created MSW handlers** in `src/test/mocks/handlers.ts` with:
  - Jira API mocks for issue retrieval
  - Confluence API mocks for page content
  - Error scenario handling (404, 403)
  - User authentication mocks
- **Created MSW server setup** in `src/test/mocks/server.ts`
- **Created test setup** in `src/test/setup.ts` with proper lifecycle management
- **Working example test** in `src/test/example.test.ts` demonstrating:
  - Basic API mocking
  - Error response testing
  - Custom mock overrides per test

### 3. Testing and Code Quality Infrastructure ✅

#### Coverage Tracking
- **Installed c8 coverage tool** (v10.1.3)
- **Created coverage configuration** in `.c8rc.json` with:
  - HTML, text, and lcov reporters
  - Proper exclusions for tests and build artifacts
  - Starting coverage targets: 20% lines, 20% functions, 15% branches
- **Added coverage scripts** to package.json:
  - `test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
  - `test:coverage:report` - Generate HTML coverage report
  - `test:coverage:check` - Enforce coverage thresholds

#### File Size Management
- **Created file size checker** in `scripts/check-file-sizes.ts` with:
  - Warning thresholds: 500 lines (.ts), 300 lines (.tsx)
  - Blocking thresholds: 800 lines (.ts), 500 lines (.tsx)
  - Colored output with actionable recommendations
- **Added file size checking** to pre-commit hooks
- **Identified current oversized files** requiring refactoring:
  - `src/lib/jira-client.ts` (1536 lines - blocking)
  - `src/lib/content-manager.ts` (1017 lines - blocking)
  - `src/lib/effects/jira-client-service.ts` (1570 lines - blocking)
  - Several others over limits

#### Pre-commit Hook Enhancement
- **Updated pre-commit script** to include:
  - Type checking (`bun run typecheck`)
  - Linting and formatting (`biome check --write`)
  - File size checking (`bun run check-file-sizes`)
- **Enhanced package.json scripts** with quality checks

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Plan ✅

Created **`TESTING_PLAN.md`** with detailed strategy for:

#### Coverage Strategy
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: 20% baseline coverage
- **Phase 2 (3 months)**: 60% coverage target
- **Phase 3 (6 months)**: 75% coverage target
- **Priority areas**: Auth, CLI commands, database operations

#### MSW Integration
- **API mocking strategy** for Jira and Confluence APIs
- **Error scenario testing** with network failures
- **Performance testing** with slow response simulation
- **Integration testing** for complete command flows

#### File Size Management
- **Automated size monitoring** with pre-commit enforcement
- **Refactoring recommendations** for oversized files
- **Tracking and reporting** of file size trends

### 5. Current Project Status

#### Working Features
- All major commands functional with Effect-based architecture
- Comprehensive specification documentation
- MSW setup ready for extensive API testing
- Coverage tracking and file size monitoring in place
- Pre-commit quality gates active

#### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Refactor oversized files** (11 files exceed blocking limits)
2. **Add unit tests** for core functions to reach 20% coverage
3. **Implement MSW tests** for API-dependent functionality
4. **Create integration tests** for complete command workflows

#### File Size Issues Requiring Attention
- **`src/lib/jira-client.ts`** (1536 lines) - Split into multiple modules
- **`src/lib/effects/jira-client-service.ts`** (1570 lines) - Extract common patterns
- **`src/lib/effects/confluence-client-service.ts`** (1319 lines) - Modularize by functionality
- **`src/lib/content-manager.ts`** (1017 lines) - Separate concerns
- **`src/cli/index.ts`** (860 lines) - Extract help functions and command routing

## Tools and Dependencies Added

- **`msw@2.10.4`** - API mocking for tests
- **`c8@10.1.3`** - Coverage tracking
- **File size checker script** - Custom solution for monitoring code size
- **Enhanced pre-commit hooks** - Quality gate enforcement

## Configuration Files Created/Updated

- **`.c8rc.json`** - Coverage configuration
- **`package.json`** - Added testing and quality scripts
- **`.gitignore`** - Added coverage directories
- **`TESTING_PLAN.md`** - Comprehensive testing strategy

## Commands Ready for Testing

The following commands have complete specifications and are ready for comprehensive test coverage:

1. **`ji mine`** - User's open issues with project filtering
2. **`ji take`** - Issue assignment 
3. **`ji issue`** - Issue viewing and project sync
4. **`ji search`** - Full-text search across content
5. **`ji sync`** - Workspace synchronization
6. **`ji auth`** - Authentication setup
7. **`ji log`** - Interactive comment viewing/editing

## Quality Gates Now Active
