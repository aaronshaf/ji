# Analysis Prompt

Analyze the following JIRA issue and comments. Identify the root cause and propose a solution approach.

## Code location

We are likely either in the relevant repository or in a parent folder which contains the relevant repository.

## Required Analysis

Begin your response with
ðŸ¤– LLM Tool
to indicate this is an automated analysis.
e.g.
ðŸ¤– Claude Code
or
ðŸ¤– Gemini

When it is wrong, disagree with previous analysis.

It is more important to be correct than to agree with previous analysis.

Provide the following sections using plain text formatting:
- Summary: State the core issue in 1-2 sentences. Note agreement or disagreement with previous analysis.
- Affected components: List specific Canvas modules/services impacted
- Key files: Identify 3-5 files most likely requiring modification using repo-relative paths only (e.g., `app/controllers/`, `app/models/`, `lib/api/` - never include machine-specific paths)
- Proposal: Primary fix location and method; data flow changes if applicable; API/database schema impacts, if any

If possible, answer any unanswered questions asked in Jira issue comments.

## Constraints

- Mention relevant specs that need updating
- Don't mention general location of fix. Opt instead for specifics. Don't say, "No [X] changes required."

Use bullet points. No introductions or conclusions. Be concise. Avoid fluff. Only include positive information â€“ ignore saying what doesn't need to be done.
